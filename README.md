# Personal-Narrative-Project
# Unit 4 - Personal Narrative

## Introduction

Images are often used to portray our personal experiences and interests. We also use image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of an image. When combined into collages and presentations, these images tell a story about who we are and what is important to us. Your goal is to create a personal narrative using The Theater that consists of images of your personal experiences and/or interests, incorporates data related to these experiences and/or interests that can be organized in a 2D array, and uses image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of your images.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, two-dimensional (2D) arrays, and algorithms to create your personal narrative collage or animation:

- **Create at least two 2D arrays** – Create at least two 2D arrays to store the data that will make up your visualization.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.
- **Use Image Filters** - Include multiple image filters learned from this unit, and additionally create new ones of your own.
- **Use methods in the String class** – Use one or more methods in the String class in your program, such as to determine whether the name of an image file contains specific characters.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an image or animation that conveys the story of the data by illustrating the patterns or relationships in the data.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## UML Diagram

Put and image of your UML Diagram here. Upload the image of your UML Diagram to your repository, then use the Markdown syntax to insert your image here. Make sure your image file name is one work, otherwise it might not properly get display on this README.

## Video

Record a short video of your story to display here on your README. You can do this by:

- Screen record your project running on Code.org.
- Upload that recording to YouTube.
- Take a thumbnail for your image.
- Upload the thumbnail image to your repo.
- Use the following markdown

Since youtube does not work for me, I chose to upload my video here.
this link has a video I uploaded that demonstrates the 2d arrays working in a new picture from the theater. 
please right click, open link in new tab
If it does not work, it may have expired, and I will be able to demonstrate it directly from my computer
## Story Description

The story that my animation showcases is my room. My room is a representation of myself, and it shows a story of what I like to do. The data that is represented in 2d array are the pixels of each image. These relate to my story that my animation showcases becasue without it, my images would not display properly.
## Image Filter Analysis

Filter #1 - The first filter that I used in my project was pixelate. This image filter works by seperating the image into chunks (stored as a parameter), and then set to be the average color of that group. It uses for loops and 2d arrays to traverse the whole image, and then sets the pixels using an "avg color" variable.

Filter #2 - The second filter that I used in my project was motion blur. This filter works by moving all the pixels a set amount in a certain direction. The directions that this filter can use is horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. Motion blur also uses 2d arrays to traverse the pixels, and has selection statements to determine what direction to move them in.
